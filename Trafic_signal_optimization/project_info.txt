**1. What is Intelligent Traffic Signal Optimization?**

Traffic congestion is a global problem impacting time, fuel, and the environment. Traditional traffic signals operate on static timers regardless of real-time traffic conditions. This leads to inefficient traffic flow and unnecessary delays.

This project solves this problem by intelligently optimizing traffic signal timing using real-time vehicle detection and lane-wise density estimation. The system utilizes YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8), a state-of-the-art object detection model, along with Canny edge detection to analyze video footage and count vehicles accurately.

A Streamlit web app provides an interface to upload traffic videos and dynamically display:

* Detected vehicle types (car, bus, truck, etc.) with counts.
* Lane-wise vehicle statistics.
* Optimal green light time calculation based on density.

This automation replaces manual observation with AI-driven decisions, increasing traffic efficiency and reducing carbon emissions.

**2. What is the Problem Statement?**

Conventional traffic systems are inefficient as they do not adapt to real-time conditions. Delays are uniform even when lanes are unevenly crowded, leading to wasted time, fuel, and frustrated commuters.

Problem Statement:

"To develop a real-time video analytics solution using computer vision (YOLOv8 + Canny edge detection) to estimate traffic density and vehicle types from uploaded videos, calculate optimal green light timings lane-wise, and visualize it via a responsive Streamlit web dashboard."

**Goals:**

* Detect vehicle types from traffic footage.
* Count vehicles lane-wise using bounding boxes.
* Estimate green light time based on density.
* Present results in a clean, professional web dashboard.

**3. Real-World Use Cases**

* ✅ **City Municipalities**: To automate adaptive signal control.
* ✅ **Smart Cities**: Integrate with IoT traffic systems.
* ✅ **Highway Authorities**: Analyze peak congestion.
* ✅ **Traffic Research Labs**: Study real-time flow models.
* ✅ **ITS Companies**: Deploy plug-and-play optimization modules.

**4. Existing System**

* Uses fixed green/red timers.
* Manual monitoring via CCTV.
* Inflexible to real-time road conditions.

**Pain Points:**

* Delays on low-density lanes.
* Traffic jams in high-density lanes.
* Wastage of fuel/time.
* No lane-wise data insight.

**5. Proposed System**

This intelligent system comprises:

* **YOLOv8**: Real-time object detection to classify vehicles.
* **Canny Edge Detection**: For visual clarity and edge recognition.
* **Streamlit Web App**: Upload videos, visualize detections, and show optimal timing.

**Architecture Workflow:**
Video Upload → Frame-by-Frame Processing → Object Detection → Vehicle Counting (by type and lane) → Timing Calculation → Streamlit Display

**Benefits:**

* Adaptive, real-time signal control.
* Web-based access, cross-platform.
* Easy to extend with more video analytics features.
